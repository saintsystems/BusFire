# BusFire

A simple [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/)-backed command/event bus for .NET — a **durable mediator**. You dispatch `ICommand`s and `IEvent`s through a MediatR-style surface; handlers run in-process by default, or — when a message opts in — as durable Hangfire background jobs (persisted, retried, schedulable, observable via the Hangfire dashboard) without standing up a separate message broker.

The design is inspired by [Laravel's bus/dispatcher](https://laravel.com/docs/queues) and its `ShouldQueue` contract: messages dispatch **in-process by default**, and run **on a durable queue when they opt in** by implementing `IShouldQueue`.

## How it works

```
                          ┌─ message is NOT IShouldQueue ─→ run inline now (BusInternal → handler)
caller → IBus.Send/Publish ┤
                          └─ message IS IShouldQueue ─→ enqueue Hangfire job → (SQL Server) → Hangfire server
                                                                                                   │
                                                               HangfireBridge → BusInternal → your handler
```

1. `IBus.Send(command)` / `Publish(event)` run the handler(s) **in-process** by default, through the pipeline behaviors, in a fresh DI scope.
2. If the message implements `IShouldQueue`, BusFire instead **enqueues a Hangfire job** so it runs durably on a Hangfire server. `Defer(...)` always queues (a delayed message can't run inline now).
3. On the queued path, Hangfire persists the job (SQL Server), a Hangfire server picks it up, and `HangfireBridge` resolves and runs the handler(s) via `BusInternal`.

Queued messages are persisted with a stable logical type name (no assembly-qualified `$type`), so jobs survive type/assembly renames; override a message's logical name with `[MessageName("...")]` if you refactor its namespace.

## Quick start

Define a command and its handler:

```csharp
// Runs inline by default. Add `, IShouldQueue` to make it run as a durable Hangfire job instead:
public record SendWelcomeEmail(string Email) : ICommand, IShouldQueue;

public class SendWelcomeEmailHandler : ICommandHandler<SendWelcomeEmail>
{
    public Task Handle(SendWelcomeEmail command, CancellationToken ct) { /* ... */ }
}
```

Register on the **producer** (anything that dispatches):

```csharp
services.AddBusFire(
    new BusOptions { ConnectionStringOrName = "BusFire" },
    cfg => cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssemblyContaining<SendWelcomeEmailHandler>());
```

Register on the **consumer** (the app that should process jobs):

```csharp
services.AddBusFireServer(); // adds the Hangfire server that drains the queues
```

Dispatch:

```csharp
await bus.Send(new SendWelcomeEmail("a@b.com"));
await bus.Defer(new SendWelcomeEmail("a@b.com"), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)); // delayed
await bus.Publish(new UserRegistered(userId));                            // fan-out to IEventHandler<UserRegistered>
```

A pure producer calls `AddBusFire` only; the worker that runs handlers also calls `AddBusFireServer`.

## Concepts

- **`ICommand` / `ICommandHandler<T>`** — one handler per command.
- **`IEvent` / `IEventHandler<T>`** — many handlers per event.
- **`IShouldQueue`** — marker a message implements to opt into durable queued dispatch; without it, dispatch runs in-process.
- **`[MessageName("...")]`** — pins a message's stable logical name on the wire so namespace/assembly renames don't break in-flight jobs.
- **Pipeline behaviors** — `ICommandPreProcessor`, `ICommandPostProcessor`, `ICommandExceptionHandler`, `ICommandExceptionAction`, `IPipelineBehavior`.
- **`IFailureHandler`** — invoked when a job exhausts retries and lands in the failed state (wired via `NotifyOnFailureAttribute`).
- **`BusFireServiceConfiguration`** — the `cfg` builder: register handler assemblies, swap the `IEventPublisher`, set the `IFailureHandler`, choose lifetimes and exception strategy.

## Operational contract

For **queued** messages (`IShouldQueue` / `Defer`), BusFire delivers **at least once** and retries the whole job on failure, so:

- **Handlers must be idempotent.**
- Events fan out to **one job per handler**, so a failure retries only that handler — not all of them. (A handler that itself isn't idempotent can still re-run on its own retry.)
- `Send`/`Publish` enqueue on Hangfire's own storage connection — they do **not** enlist in your business DB transaction. Use an outbox or transaction enlistment if you need exactly-once-relative-to-your-data semantics.
